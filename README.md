### Summary ###

The main purpose of this library is promote research in random
finite set (RFS) estimation methods for the problem of simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM). The intention of the authors is to keep the library general 
in the sense that users can define system models that are relevant to their 
specific problem, while not having to program and test their own implementation 
of RFS filters. This library is an on-going project, and we intend to update it 
when any related work is published. Any feedback will be appreciated. 

* License: New BSD
* Version: 1.1.0
* Compiles with gcc on Linux (Ubuntu 13.04, 13.10, 14.04)

### Installation ###

#### Source ####

Obtain from git repository: `https://kykleung@bitbucket.org/kykleung/phdfilter.git`

#### C++ Library Dependencies ####

* Boost (version 1.53 minimum) with components:
    * math_c99
    * timer
    * system
    * thread
    * filesystem
    * graph 
* Eigen (version 3.0.0 minimum)
* gtest 
  
    If using Ubuntu apt-get to install: 

    1. `sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev`
    2. `cd /usr/src/gtest`
    3. `cmake .`
    4. `make`
    5. `sudo mv libgtest_main.a /usr/lib/`
    6. `sudo mv libgtest.a /usr/lib/`

* libconfig (optional, for the 2-D SLAM simulators )

#### Other Dependencies ####

For visualizing 2-D SLAM results

* python-numpy (for visualizing 2-D SLAM results)
* python-matplotlib (for visualizing 2-D SLAM results)

#### Compiling ####

For out-of-source build of the library and the 2D simulator:

* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`
* `make install` (option, and produces install_manifest.txt)

#### Documentation ####

Documentations can be generated using *Doxygen*, and we have provided a Doxyfile
(configuration file). To generate the html and pdf documentations **Doxygen needs
to be installed**. Run `doxygen` in project root directory.
Documentation will be generated in `doc/` directory.

### Usage Example ###

#### SLAM Filters ####

* Rao-Blackwellized Probability Hypothesis Density (RB-PHD) SLAM 2-D Simulation
    - Source: src/rbphdslam2dSim.cpp
    - Config: cfg/rbphdslam2dSim.cfg
    - Run: `bin/rbphdslam2dSim [random_seed=0] [cfg_file=cfg/rbphdslam2dSim.cfg]`

* Factored Solution to SLAM (FastSLAM 1.0) 2-D Simulation
    - Source: src/fastslam2dSim.cpp 
    - Config: cfg/fastslam2dSim.cfg
    - Run: `bin/fastslam2dSim [random_seed=0] [cfg_file=cfg/fastslam2dSim.cfg]`

* Multi-Hypothesis Factored Solution to SLAM (MH FastSLAM) 2-D Simulation
    - Source: src/fastslam2dSim.cpp 
    - Config: cfg/mhfastslam2dSim.cfg
    - Run: `bin/fastslam2dSim [random_seed=0] [cfg_file=cfg/mhfastslam2dSim.cfg]`

#### Visualization Tools ####

For animating 2D SLAM results, run: `bin/animate2dSim.py [results_dir]`. 
Edit the python script and set `saveMoive=False` to see animation.
Set `saveMoive=True` to generate a mp4 file.

### Version History ###

* 1.0.0 
    - Initial release

* 1.1.0
    - RB-PHD SLAM algorithm updates:
        - included multi-feature particle importance weighting strategy
        - included single-cluster (SC)-PHD SLAM weighting strategy
    - new FastSLAM and MH-FastSLAM algorithms included 
    - updated 2-D simulations
    - new Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) error metric class 
    - visualization tools are now in Python instead of Matlab
    - introduced namespace rfs to the library
    - some updates made to naming convention of classes in the library
    - cmake now generates rfsslam-config.cmake to enable find(rfsslam) 
      from other projects

* Latest
    - Implementation of joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) 
      for data association in vector-based methods

### Future Work ###

- Remove dependency on libconfig, and switch to boost::program_option
- Multi-threaded versions of SLAM algorithms
- Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter
- Multi-Bernoulli filter
